# Most-Productive-teams-and-his-Key-Player-in-2020-in-top-5-League-Europe
The 2020-2021 season has ended in each league. the season is running competitively. A lot of great and interesting things happened in that season. 
But I'm curious, can we see who is the most productive team at the end of the season by looking at their performances at the beginning of the season? 
this time i will try to see this point of view with the dataset i found from kaggle. This dataset contains teams from the top leagues in the world.
I will see it in the top 5 European leagues which we know are the best leagues in the world. 
This dataset in 2020 was created when the leagues were still running around 9-11 gameweek.
